# DfE Analytical Services

> **Warning** the name of the organisation is under review. Some options:
* DfE R Community
* DfE Analytical Community
* DfE Data Science
* Department for Education
* DfE Open-Source

## Purpose
This organisation may be used:

* To share open-source tools developed by civil servants at the DfE, e.g. 
  R packages we want to publish on CRAN.
  
* For transparency purposes, e.g. all our public-facing Shiny apps should
  also have publicly available source code

If you are a DfE analyst and would like to create a new repo, please contact
one of the [project owners](#contacts)

## Governance
We want **org name here** to be as open as possible to DfE analysts. You 
should considering hosting your code here if all of the following are true:

* Your code does **NOT** contain any sensitive data, e.g. any non-public data
  or information about internal DfE systems
  
* Your code may be useful to the general public. Examples may include small,
  self-contained tools or other resources such as training materials.

** ... more specific rules here? E.g. you must complete your 'responsible for 
information** training etc?
