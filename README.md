# DfE Analytical Services GitHub Organisation

This repo contains documents around governance and how this organisation should be
used, including notes and example best practices used within the Statistics Services Unit who manage this organisation overall.

`profile/README.md` is used as the organisation README visible at https://github.com/dfe-analytical-services.

Example standard GitHub files are included and can be copied and adapted for other repositories:

- [Code of conduct]()
- [Pull request template]()
- [Issue templates]()
- [Security policy]()

Contributing files, READMEs and Licenses are all specific to individual repositories so we currently do not have templates in here for those.
