We want dfe-analytical-services to be as open as possible to all working in analysis in DfE. You should considering hosting your code here if all of the following are true:

* Your code does **NOT** contain any sensitive or unpublished data, and should not share information about DfE internal systems
* Your code may be useful to others outside of DfE. For example, to give transparency of code for published analysis or services, share common components or packages, or for other resources such as training materials.
