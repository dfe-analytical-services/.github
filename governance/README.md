# Governance
We want **org name here** to be as open as possible to DfE analysts. You 
should considering hosting your code here if all of the following are true:

* Your code does **NOT** contain any sensitive data, e.g. any non-public data
  or information about DfE-internal systems
* Your code may be useful to the general public. Examples may include small,
  self-contained tools or other resources such as training materials.

Other possible rules we should think about:

* Projects must be licensed as... **????** Possible issues unless we think
  about this properly
* Training you must complete to work on projects, e.g. responsible for 
  information
* You must have 2-factor auth enabled
* All repos should have a readme with an initial section which concisely
  describes what the repo is for and who it's aimed at... ? I think
  standardising this would be nice if we can make it quite flexible.
  A few repos I've checked don't make this super obvious.
